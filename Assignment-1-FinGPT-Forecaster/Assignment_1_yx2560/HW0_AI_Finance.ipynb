KO showed impressive financial performance with net revenue experiencing a robust 6% growth, reaching $12 billion.\\n2. Coca-Cola's reputation as a dependable dividend payer draws investors seeking stable income over time, securing its position as a reliable investment option.\\n3. The company has been recognized as a \\\"Dividend King\\\", a distinction that increases its appeal to investors seeking long-term investment prospects.\\n\\n[Potential Concerns]:\\n1. The company's stock price has been on a downward trend for two consecutive weeks, which may signal the beginnings of negative market sentiment.\\n2. Coca-Cola's high total debt to equity ratio indicates that the company is using debt to finance its business operations, which can potentially expose the company to financial risks should market conditions turn unfavorable.\\n3. Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's recent share sell-offs in other companies could be concerning if such behavior extends to Coca-Cola.\\n\\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\\nPrediction: Down by 1-2%\\nAnalysis: While Coca Cola has demonstrated its financial strength, robust returns, and consistent dividend payouts, short-term concerns like the general downward trend of its stock price and the company's relatively high debt pose barriers to immediate stock price growth. These factors may be temporary, but they impact investor sentiment in the short term and will likely contribute to a modest decrease in the company's stock price in the week from 2023-08-27 to 2023-09-03. The decrease might be between 1-2%. However, investors\\u2019 long-term confidence in Coca-Cola, courtesy of its solid financial performance and status as a reliable dividend payer, indicates a resilient future outlook. As such, this short-term downtrend does not necessarily reflect negatively on the company's overall future performance potential.\",\n          \"[Positive Developments]:\\n1. Merck & Co Inc's stock continues to grow despite a challenging market environment, with events such as rising 0.83% higher on a dismal trading session and 0.98% higher on a strong trading day. \\n2. The company is being recognized in influential financial analyses, appearing in articles like the top Dow stocks billionaires are loading up on, which can increase investor interest and confidence. \\n3. Medicare has allowed pharmaceutical companies to publicly discuss drug price negotiations, potentially easing pressure on the pharmaceutical sector's profitability and granting Merck & Co. better predictability with regard to revenues and costs.\\n\\n[Potential Concerns]:\\n1. Merck & Co Inc has faced a significant setback, with its Keytruda regimen failing to improve event-free survival in gastric cancer patients, as reported in two separate instances. This could hinder the company's growth and profitability, particularly if the drug was projected to be a significant source of future revenue. \\n2. Merck is involved in a potentially impactful lawsuit concerning Medicare's drug price negotiation plans. The outcome of these complex legal issues is uncertain, potentially posing significant risks to the company.\\n\\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\\nPrediction: Down by more than 5%\\nAnalysis: Given recent developments, a prediction for a more than 5% drop in Merck's stock price over the next week could be supported by several observations. Firstly, the conspicuous failure of the company's Keytruda regimen to meet primary goals in a late-stage study for advanced gastric cancer patients may have serious implications on the company's projected earnings and tarnish its innovative reputation. Negative clinical trials can often significantly impact a healthcare company's stock price.\\n\\nFurthermore, the ongoing legal case dealing with Medicare's drug price negotiation plans introduces an element of uncertainty that the stock market generally dislikes. If Merck's lawsuits against the policy fail, it could lead to reduced margins and profit for the company, hurting its financial performance, which is already weak as indicated by negative EBIT per share and EPS.\\n\\nAlthough various news favor the bulls, including the permission to publicly discuss drug price negotiations and the talk around billionaire investors, the weight of the negative news seems overwhelming at this stage, implying potential downside risks. Of course, this does not fully consider potential unexpected news that can always change the stock price direction.\",\n          \"[Positive Developments]:\\n1. Company Strategies & Relationships: The company's strategic moves of forming partnerships and collaborations with big names like Microsoft and Samsung showcases a significant commitment to enhancing product offerings and adaptability to market needs. This may attract investors.\\n\\n2. Company Financials: Their Ev-to-Ebitda ratio (15.8) is fair, indicating that the company is undervalued according to basic investing standards.\\n\\n[Potential Concerns]:\\n1. Frequent Stock Underperformance: In the past few weeks, the stock has underperformed when compared to its competitors in several sessions. This might breed uncertainty among investors.\\n\\n2. Slow Growth Prospects: Some news, such as the headline \\\"Cisco: Sluggish Growth Ahead, But Shares Priced For Pessimism\\\" suggest that future growth may be slow.\\n\\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\\nPrediction: Down by 3-4%\\nAnalysis: Given the combination of negative sentiment from the market and news of sluggish growth predictions, we expect that investor sentiment may slide towards a negative stance in the following week. This sentiment, combined with persistent underperformance in comparison to competitors, could lead to pressure on the stock price. Additionally, while Cisco Systems Inc's strategic partnerships signify enhancements and potential growth in their corporate portfolio, it may not be enough to instigate an immediate bullish trend considering the overall economic climate. This heads up for potential underperformance in the week might discourage trading activity and result in a downward pressure on the stock price. Therefore, despite the strong fundamentals of the company, we predict the stock price to go down by 3-4% in the next week.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"period\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2023-10-29 to 2023-11-05\",\n          \"2023-08-13 to 2023-08-20\",\n          \"2023-07-09 to 2023-07-16\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"down by more than 5%\",\n          \"up by 4-5%\",\n          \"up by 3-4%\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"symbol\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"WMT\",\n          \"MCD\",\n          \"CRM\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import torch\n","from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n","from peft import PeftModel\n","import time\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from typing import Dict, List, Any\n","import re\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","class FinGPTEvaluator:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        \"\"\"Initialize the FinGPT evaluator with the base Llama-2 model\"\"\"\n","        print(\"Loading base Llama-2 model...\")\n","        self.base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n","            'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf',\n","            trust_remote_code=True,\n","            device_map=\"auto\",\n","            torch_dtype=torch.float16\n","        )\n","        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf')\n","        self.model = None\n","\n","    def load_dataset(self, dataset_path: str, split: str = 'train') -> pd.DataFrame:\n","        \"\"\"Load the FinGPT dataset from the specified path\"\"\"\n","        splits = {\n","            'train': 'data/train-00000-of-00001-7c4c80aa07272d4c.parquet',\n","            'test': 'data/test-00000-of-00001-28531804b005ddc6.parquet'\n","        }\n","\n","        full_path = f\"hf://datasets/FinGPT/fingpt-forecaster-dow30-202305-202405/{splits[split]}\"\n","        return pd.read_parquet(full_path)\n","\n","    def load_model(self, lora_path: str) -> None:\n","        \"\"\"Load the FinGPT model with specified LoRA weights\"\"\"\n","        print(f\"Loading FinGPT model with LoRA weights from: {lora_path}\")\n","        self.model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(\n","            self.base_model,\n","            lora_path\n","        ).eval()\n","\n","    def generate_forecast(self, prompt: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n","        \"\"\"Generate forecast using the loaded model with metrics\"\"\"\n","        if self.model is None:\n","            raise ValueError(\"Model not loaded.
