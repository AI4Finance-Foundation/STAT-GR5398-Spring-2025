      "[Summary]: Just do it. Nike's (NKE) slogan and 'Swoosh' logo that defines the iconic brand is now a staple for footwear, athletic apparel, and pop culture. The company generated more than $51 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of about $4.5 billion year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at Nike's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker, which charts its path to becoming a global icon. 1964 Nike was originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman on January 25, 1964. 1971 The company was renamed Nike and began using the 'Swoosh' logo, created by Portland State University student Carolyn Davis, who sold Nike the logo for just $35. 1980 On December 2, 1980, Nike went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ at $22 per share. 1984 The company signed Michael Jordan, launching the Air Jordan series. Within the first two months of the shoe’s release, Nike sold $70 million worth of Air Jordans. 1997 Nike spun the Jordan brand into its own division featuring the 'Jumpman' logo. 2004 Nike acquired rival Converse for $309 million. Later that year, Phil Knight stepped down as CEO and president of Nike, but continued his chairman role. 2012 Nike became the official supplier for NFL apparel. 2013 Nike became a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing Alcoa (AA). 2015 The company was named the official supplier for NBA apparel. 2016 Phil Knight officially stepped down from all duties with the company on June 30, 2016. 2019 In November 2019, Nike stopped selling directly through Amazon (AMZN), focusing more on direct relationships with customers. 2021 On November 5, 2021, Nike stock hit an all-time high, trading at $173.12 per share. With the stock down nearly 20% over the past year, as concerns over slowing sales growth and demand in China mount, investors are waiting for the next leg of innovation from the shoe company. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

The tech giant is just one of three \"Magnificent 7\" stocks that are underperforming this year. However, KeyBanc has initiated coverage on Microsoft (MSFT) as Overweight, setting a price target of $490. Keybanc Managing Director of Software Equity Research Jackson Ader joins the Live show to discuss his call. What sets Microsoft apart from other tech names is its AI monetization abilities, Adler highlights. The analyst explains that Microsoft is monetizing via Keybanc's preferred pathways: metering workload to the cloud and direct monetization from co-pilot. \"They are actually putting revenue on the board, whereas a lot of other software companies right now, it's speculation,\" Adler states. In Keybanc surveys, Adler continues, CIOs claim Microsoft has AI capabilities that are \"superior\" over other vendors: \"Customers are saying this is where we want to go for AI,\" Adler concludes.

U.S. consumer spending has remained remarkably resilient despite higher-for-longer interest rates, with Americans still looking to spend on big-ticket purchases and international travel.  Visa executives in a call with analysts said international travel continues to be healthy, particularly out of the key markets of the U.S. and Europe, but flagged that Asia-Pacific travel has been weak as the post-pandemic recovery continues to be slower than expected.\n",

The first-quarter performance and expectations that currency headwinds will abate somewhat and that its product mix will have positive effects in the second half give Warburg confidence that Adidas's gross margin will substantially beat expectations, the analyst says.\n",

      "[Summary]: During Biden's State of the Union address, the president addressed shrinkflation and soaring grocery prices faced by consumers. To analyze the factors driving shrinkflation and how companies can combat the ongoing crisis, Solomon Partners Head of Grocery Scott Moses joins Yahoo Finance Live. Moses explained that food inflation has been propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, global ecological shortages, and geopolitical tensions. However, he notes that food manufacturers \"continuously taking price increases\" have further fueled the situation. Conversely, Moses highlights companies like Kroger (KR) that are \"clearly committed\" to maintaining affordable prices to assist \"millions of families\" in combating food inflation. To achieve lower prices, Moses suggests that supermarket grocers \"need to get bigger\" in the long term to compete with national discount grocers like Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT), which currently dominate over 60% of the market share.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

The Big Bank stocks have all since slid lower Friday morning. HSBC Head of US Financials Research Saul Martinez explains the most important figures from these three major banks, including quarterly net interest income while the financial sector traverses inflation and higher for longer interest rates. \"If you think back to the first quarter, we had six rate cuts priced in. Now we have around two rate cuts. So I think there was some hope that that change in the rate outlook coupled with the fact that JPMorgan has been fairly conservative in their net interest income guidance, that that would lead to an increase in the outlook,\" Martinez tells Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. \"The tone was, in my view, was somewhat cautious.

      "[Summary]: In the wake of earnings reports from major banks like Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), a mixed picture is emerging about the state of consumer spending. While the banks have stressed that consumers are continuing to spend despite uncertainty around inflation, there are also signs of rising consumer credit stress. Bank of America, for instance, reported that its net charge-offs — debts unlikely to be recovered — rose to $1.5 billion year over year, up from $807 million in the prior-year period. At the same time, banks have noted a decline in net interest income, which is the difference between what banks earn on loans and what they pay on deposits. These figures raise concerns about whether consumers can sustain their current spending habits in an inflationary environment.

      "[Headline]: Why it may be time to start looking at value stocks\n",
      "[Summary]: Stocks (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) ended the week higher thanks to some strong quarterly reports from the likes of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Value stocks have been out of favor for the last few years, but value investor John Bailer, Newton Investment Management Deputy Head of Equity Income and Portfolio Manager, thinks that is going to change. Bailer believes that the decade following the 2008 financial crisis was an \"anomaly\" rather than the norm given how low rates had to be to spur economic growth. He says that rates have tended to skew, historically, to 4%-5% and, in that environment, value stocks tend to be what works. \"I do think that, for lots of reasons, we're going to have a little more inflation, a little higher interest rates. Money isn't going to be free any longer. And value will come back into favor,\" Bailer claims. Watch the video above to hear why Bailer says JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is a value stock to consider.
